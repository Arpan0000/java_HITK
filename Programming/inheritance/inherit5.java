/*5. Consider an example of book shop which sells books & video tapes. Itâ€™s modeled by Book &
Tape classes. These two classes are inherited from the abstract class called Media. The Media
class has common data members such as title & publication. The Book class has data
member for storing a no. of pages in a book & Tape class has the playing time in a tape. Each
class will have method such as read ( ) & show ( ). Write a program that models this class
hierarchy & processes objects using reference to base class only.*/
